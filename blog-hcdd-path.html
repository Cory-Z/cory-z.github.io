        <p class="hero-subtitle">
          I didn’t start out planning to be a UX or product designer. I started
          in engineering, and eventually realized that what I cared about most
          wasn’t just how systems worked, it was how people experienced them.

        <h2>Starting in engineering</h2>
        <p>
          My first step into tech was through engineering. I liked solving
          problems, building things, and understanding how systems fit together.
          But as I progressed, I noticed that the parts of projects that excited
          me most weren’t the calculations or the specs, but instead they were the moments
          where I could think about the person on the other side of the screen.
        </p>

        <p>
          I found myself asking questions like: Who is this for? Will this
          actually make their day easier? What does this look and feel like when
          someone is tired, stressed, or in a hurry? Those questions didn’t
          always fit neatly into a traditional engineering mindset, but they
          always stuck with me.
        </p>

        <h2>Discovering Human-Centered Design</h2>
        <p>
          That’s what eventually led me to Human-Centered Design & Development
          at Penn State. HCDD felt like the missing piece. It felt like a place where
          caring about interfaces, flows, and user emotions wasn’t a side habit,
          it was the entire point.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned how to connect research, design, and development into a
          single process: Talking to users, mapping their journeys, sketching
          out solutions, prototyping, and then actually building them. It was
          engineering, but with people fully in the center of every decision.
        </p>

        <h2>Why digital experiences clicked for me</h2>
        <p>
          The more I worked on interfaces and digital products, the more I
          realized how much impact they can have. A small change in a flow can
          save someone time every single day. A clear screen can reduce anxiety.
          A smarter layout can make complicated information feel manageable.
        </p>

        <p>
          I loved the idea that I could design something online that quietly
          improves someone’s life. Whether it helped them navigate a busy
          campus, understand a property investment, or just find what they need
          without thinking too hard, I became invested.
        </p>

        <h2>Why HCDD feels like the right path</h2>
        <p>
          Human-Centered Design & Development gives me a way to bring together
          everything I care about: the structure and logic of engineering, the
          creativity of design, and the empathy of talking to real people. It’s
          a path where I get to build things that work and feel right.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, when I look at the projects in my portfolio, from event
          navigation to AI-powered property tools, I see the same thread
          running through all of them: a focus on real users, real problems, and
          experiences that try to respect people’s time and attention.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s the kind of work I want to keep doing as I move into
          full-time roles: designing and building digital experiences that are
          not just functional, but genuinely helpful.
