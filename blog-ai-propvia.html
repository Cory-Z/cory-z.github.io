        <h2>Starting with a messy, real-world problem</h2>
        <p>
          When I joined Propvia as a Mobile Developer Intern, the goal wasn’t just to
          ship another app screen — it was to help investors make faster, smarter
          decisions about real properties in real neighborhoods. The product pulls in a
          lot of data: vacancy information, risk indicators, neighborhood metrics, and
          more. Without good UX, all of that can quickly turn into noise.
        </p>

        <p>
          My job was to help bring Propvia’s web experience to mobile while keeping it
          focused, approachable, and useful in the moments when investors actually need
          it — on the go, in the field, or between meetings.
        </p>

        <h2>Where AI comes in</h2>
        <p>
          Under the hood, Propvia uses AI to evaluate properties and surface insights
          that would be hard to see at a glance. Instead of asking users to dig through
          raw numbers, the product can highlight patterns, risks, and opportunities and
          turn them into plain-language guidance.
        </p>

        <p>
          For me as a UX-focused developer, that meant thinking about questions like:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-details">
          <li>How do we present AI-generated insights so they feel trustworthy, not mysterious?</li>
          <li>How much detail should we show by default vs. behind a tap?</li>
          <li>How can we let users drill into the data without overwhelming them?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Designing the mobile experience</h2>
        <p>
          On mobile, screen space is tight, attention is short, and context is constantly
          shifting. I collaborated with designers to adapt the design system to mobile,
          then implemented key flows using React Native and Expo. We focused on:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-details">
          <li>Making property summaries scannable in a few seconds</li>
          <li>Highlighting the most important AI-driven callouts first</li>
          <li>Keeping actions like saving, comparing, or sharing properties easy to reach</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Throughout the internship, I iterated based on feedback from the team, adjusting
          layouts, copy, and interactions to make sure the AI never felt like a black box
          bolted onto the side of the app. Instead, it needed to feel like a natural
          extension of the product.
        </p>

        <h2>What I learned about AI-assisted product design</h2>
        <p>
          The biggest lesson for me was that “AI features” aren’t that interesting on their
          own. What matters is how they show up in the experience. Some takeaways:
        </p>

        <ul class="project-details">
          <li>AI should reduce cognitive load, not increase it.</li>
          <li>Clear, honest language builds more trust than technical jargon.</li>
          <li>Users appreciate having both a quick summary and a way to dig deeper.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Working on Propvia showed me how UX, engineering, and AI can come together to
          solve real problems and not just as a buzzword, but as part of a thoughtful,
          human-centered product.
        </p>

        <p>
          Going forward, I’m excited to keep exploring how AI can support people’s
          decision-making without taking control away from them. Whether it's in
          real estate, event navigation, or whatever problem I get to work on next, 
          I'm look forward to seeing where AI takes us.
